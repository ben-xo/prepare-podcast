Possible Enhancements:
======================
  - From id3.org v1 compatibility tests:
     - id3v1_272_extra.mp3 -- utf-8 data in v1.  Is this even valid???
     - id3v1_007_basic_W.mp3 -- Need to ignore/error on junk data,
                                depending on non-strict/strict
     ? Decoding errors on all genres higher than 128?  
     X id3v1_014_year_F.mp3 is supposed to cause decoding error, but that's
       bunk.
  - From id3.org v2.2.0 compatibility tests:
    - 0101805.tag - Oi! genre
  - From id3.org v2.3.0 compatibility tests:
    0120568.tag - encoding error

  ~ bin/eyeD3 XML output.
  ~ Regression/unit test app.
  - Native Support for: MCDI, IPLS/TIPL, TEXT, USLT
                        SYLT, TDAT (2.3 rendering TDRC)
  - thatspot.tag - Parses fine, but native support for TMED, USLT, POPM,
                   TLEN, and IPLS is needed.

Useful options that could be added:
==================================
  - -P, --force-padding           Enforce padding of tag data
  - --padded-size                 Set padded size
  - -E, --export[=FILENAME]       Export tag(s) to file

Extra Credit:
==============
  - Handle appended ID3v2 tags, SEEK frames, and footers.

  - Native support for all frames!
  - Abide by read only and tag/file alter flags in tag header when
    setting/saving.
  - Abide by extended header restrictions when setting/saving.
  - Ogg tag reading
  - Ogg tag writing
  - Ogg audio spec support
  - GUI
